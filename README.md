# THE IDEA

The idea is to create an AWS instance (Ubuntu) in multiple regions (free-tier) (eu-west-1 and eu-central-1)

# REQUIREMENTS

- Should be on, minimum, 2 availability zones
- Should be reusable
- Ensure that the infrastructures can be built on multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Script that creates an Ansible, Docker container
- Your scripts should be modularized

# NOTE

Create a VPC for the various environments where applicable
